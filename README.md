my first website, i feel so excited to finish it. It just a simple one page website, 
but it still means much to me. 
Some month ago i try to bilde a website mayself for fun, 
but i didn't make it. And this time, i did't expected to make it, i just want to make a interactive image,
and i somehow achieved it. It's really funny. 

and like always, my best helper
I'm thrilled to announce the completion of my first websiteâ€”a simple one-page creation that holds significant meaning for me. 
A few months ago, I embarked on the journey of building a website for fun but faced challenges and couldn't see it through. 
This time around, my goal was to create an interactive image, and unexpectedly, I not only achieved that but also managed to finish the entire website. 
It's truly an exciting and fulfilling experience for me.

not fulfilling, but just funny, i really laugh about this.
